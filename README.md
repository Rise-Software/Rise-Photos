## What is Rise Photos?
Rise Photos is an all new photo management and editing app for the Windows platform. It brings together features from your favourite photo apps and programs from all your different devices into an easy to use, clutter free and beautiful interface that is customisable to your needs. 

Adjust your collection to your hearts content, adding relevant metadata, sorting in many ways and grouping your photos together into albums. We really want your photos to work for you, and we'll continue to improve this over the course of development. Edit your photos with simple sliders and recognisable buttons. Personalise your photos by adding your own doodles, and make your portraits look more professional than ever using our Studio filters (coming soon). Share and print your photos to keep and show to your friends, and even share your editing style by creating your own filters!

And, do it all with consistency, thanks to WinUI 2.8. We have built Rise Photos with your device in mind, designing every detail so our app fits right in with your Windows installation.

Rise Photos is not complete without Rise+, a new online service coming to all Rise Software apps in 2023 that allows you to sync your settings and share amongst the growing Rise Software community! We can't wait for you to try it! (Rise+ is coming in 2023 and will not be available during the Alpha stages of development).
